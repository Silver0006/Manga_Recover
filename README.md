# Update
I have decided to cancel this project. A simple search through GitHub can find applications with the same capability and far superior ability. 
I originally started this project to help myself learn selenium. I believe that further development using selenium would be a waste and would like to focus my abilities elsewhere.
I have found a far more efficient way to develop such a program which I will continue to do in private.

# Manga_Recover
A project I started to learn more about selenium in Python. The program is designed to allow you to download Manga in a PDF from https://global.bookwalker.jp/

Packaged in AUTO-PY-TO-EXE and NSIS.

It currently works in English and is very temperamental. I plan to continue development adding further support and stability.
There is a slight problem with Captcha and Bookwalker's system, which means it may take a few attempts. You may also have to wait in between tries. I plan to fix this in a later update.

Relies on Google Chrome or Firefox being installed.

## Instructions
1. Open the program and enter login. 
2. Wait until the console lists links. Find the link to the manga you want and enter it.
3. Let the program run until it closes.
4. PDF should be in the same directory as the EXE file.
