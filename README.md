# Manga_Recover
A project I started to learn more about selenium in python. The program is designed to allow you to download Manga in a PDF from https://global.bookwalker.jp/

It currently works in english and is very tempermental. I plan to continue development adding further support and stability.
There is a slight problem with captcha and Bookwalker's own system which means it may take a few attempt. You may also have to wait inbetween trys. I plan to fix this in a later update.

## Instructions
1. Open program enter login. 
2. Wait until console lists links. Find the link of the manga you want and enter it.
3. Let the program run until it closes.
4. PDF should be in the same directory as the EXE file.
